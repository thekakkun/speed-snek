# Speed Snek: A game of Snake, _on speed_!

[**It can be played in it's current form here!**](https://thekakkun.github.io/speed-snek/)

This game is still in development. [Read more about its goings-on here](https://thekakkun.github.io/blog?tag=speed+snek).

## What is it?

A mash-up of the classic [computer game Snake](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>) and the [1994 movie Speed](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_(1994_film)>) starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Control the snek to eat pellets. Game over if you go under the speed limit, or if you crash into yourself or the walls.

This project was used to teach myself about:

- Object oriented programming
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- HTML canvas
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

## The rules of the game

- Control the snek with your mouse or finger
- Eating pellets will increase:
  - your score
  - the length of your snek
  - the minimum speed limit
- Game over if you:
  - Hit yourself
  - Hit the wall
  - Go under the minimum speed limit

## Todo


- [ ] Tweak the difficulty curve, consider adding lives maybe?
- [ ] Maybe different kinds of food pellets? Power-ups?
- [x] Figure out scaling on phone screens
- [x] Create a minimal version of the game
