[Read more about the development of the game here](https://thekakkun.github.io/blog?tag=speed+snek).

## What is it?

A mash-up of [the classic computer game _Snake_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>) and [the 1994 movie _Speed_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_(1994_film)>) starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock.

## The rules of the game

🎮 Control the snek with your mouse or finger

👍 Eat the pellets! They'll increase:

- your score
- the length of your snek
- the minimum speed limit

❌ Be careful! Game over if you:

- go below the minimum speed limit
- hit yourself or the wall

## Todo

- [ ] Tweak the difficulty curve, consider adding lives maybe?
- [ ] Maybe different kinds of food pellets? Power-ups?
- [x] Figure out scaling on phone screens
- [x] Create a minimal version of the game
- [x] Implement a starting screen and game over menu
- [x] Finish the speed & score UI
- [x] Visual design overhaul
