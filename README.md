# üêç Speed Snek: The game of Snake, _on speed_!

**Speed Snek can be played [right here on GitHub](https://thekakkun.github.io/speed-snek/) or [at itch.io](https://kakkun.itch.io/speed-snek/)!**

[Read more about the development of the game here](https://thekakkun.github.io/blog?tag=speed+snek).

## What is it?

A mash-up of [the classic computer game _Snake_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>) and [the 1994 movie _Speed_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_(1994_film)>) starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock.

## The rules of the game

üéÆ Control the snek with your mouse or finger

üëç Eat the pellets! They'll increase:

- your score
- the length of your snek
- the minimum speed limit

‚ùå Be careful! It's game over if you:

- go below the minimum speed limit
- collide into yourself or the wall
